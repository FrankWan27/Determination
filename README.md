Mobile Rhythm Game

## About this project
Inspired by my favorite mobile games, Deemo and VOEZ, I wanted to make a rhythm game that had a dynamic number of lanes, where the user would swipe left and right to create or remove lanes. I made the game work in portrait mode because I envisioned a local versus mode where each player plays on opposite halves of the screen.
